# Advent of Code

I'm doing Advent of Code! Read all about it [here](https://adventofcode.com/).

Apart from having some fun, I'm going to use the game to get more comfy with Java.

Hopefully I'll find time to keep up with it each day alongside a full-time job. If I can, I know it's going to help my Java skillz no end. 

My approach is to dump the example code given in each example into a unit test, and then pass it!

I'm hoping to see an improvement in the quality of my code as I go. I'm writing this intro on Day 2 and it's been pretty hairy so far... 

### ⭐ ⭐ Day One - [Chronal Calibratrion](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/1)
- Find the sum of a big set of "frequencies"
- Find the first "frequency" to repeat twice

### ⭐ ⭐ Day Two - [Inventory Management System](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/2)
- Create a [checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum) for a list of box numbers
- Find the two closest box numbers
